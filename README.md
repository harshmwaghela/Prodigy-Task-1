# Prodigy-Task-1
My project focused on creating a bar chart or histogram to show how a crucial variable—such as age or gender—was distributed among a population. This included using Python programming in Jupyter Notebook and relying on crucial tools such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib alongside Seaborn for advanced data visualization.
